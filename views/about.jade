          li <strong>Write</strong> poetry! It's the soul of poetry Link, without it there is nothing.
          li Use other people's lines to write new poems! You can <strong>select any line</strong> of any poem and make something new with it.
          li <strong>Interact</strong> with other authors. If someone uses one of your lines, continue the game and write something with a line from their poem.

        div.spacer
        p I am a Chinese Scholar, music producer and poet attempting to expand my creative universe via comuter programming and web development. Poetry Link is my first project. It was inspired by East Asian poetry games and the idea that sharing is good.

          li Do not get mad when other people use your writing! If your work is personal or copywrited <strong>do not</strong> put it on Poetry Link.
          li Someone else's line may be used as the first or last line of a new poem. Sorry folks, games have rules.
          li I've got a pretty open mind, but if you write a lot of really disgusting stuff on my site I will <strong>delete</strong> it. As site creator I retain the right to remove your content.
          li This website is stored on a computer along with everything you write on it. Computers are error prone! If you like what you write, <strong>copy it down</strong> in a real notebook. If something goes wrong I take no responsibility for work lost on my site.
